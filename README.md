# ESP32 Zone Alarm

An ESP32 based single zone alarm system using Arduino framework.

This was a project for FAU Embedded Systems CDA4630 class. 

This project uses an [ESP32 Thing Plus C](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/20168) from [SparkFun](https://www.sparkfun.com/) Electronics.

It is written in C++ using Visual Studio Code and the PlatformIO extension.

This code and project is fully functional, however I would like to rewrite it using FreeRTOS.
